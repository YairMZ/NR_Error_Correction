Specs for codes:

Long messages - standard Matlab codes, DVB-S.2 spec. See Matlab script regarding generation of matrices.
123B messages - using supplied parity check matrix.

It includes two parity check matrices (for the same code), one systematic and the other isn't.
The systematic one is used for encoding.
The non-systematic one (which is sparser) is used for decoding.
The non-systematic H is much sparser (density of 0.0011 vs 0.08 of systematic H), which causes decoding to bo much more efficient.

To use in code:
k = size(H, 2) - size(H, 1);
n = size(H, 2);

encoding:
[rH, cH] = find(H);
EncHInd = [rH, cH];
hEnc = comm.LDPCEncoder(EncHInd);
V = step(hEnc, EncBits(1: k));


decoding:
[rH, cH] = find(Hnonsys);
DecHInd = single([rH, cH]);
hDec = comm.LDPCDecoder(DecHInd);
V = step(hDec, DecBits(1: n));
